- New error aggregation strategy proposed for distributed tasks, improving root cause identification

### Topics

#### Large Object Handling
Upcoming feature to offload large objects to Blob store, circumventing gRPC limitations.
Configurable thresholds for when objects get offloaded (min/max sizes).
No new flags or opt-in mechanism; seamless integration with existing SDK.
#### Binary IDL (Implementation in Progress)
Addresses multiple issues: JSON-like object encoding, data classes, Pydantic models, union types
Reuses existing literal types, reducing deployment risks
Improves developer experience across various contexts (e.g., dictionaries with integer values)
Beta release expected in November, including UI visualization updates.

#### Error Aggregation for Distributed Tasks
New RFC proposes timestamp-based error aggregation for distributed training jobs
Aims to solve race conditions in error reporting for multi-pod setups
Key changes:
Unique error file names (UUID-based) to avoid overwrites
Error documents to include timestamps and worker names
New error file reader in Propeller to aggregate multiple error files
Plugin properties to specify error aggregation strategy
Backwards compatibility considerations included

#### Community Plugins
Updated process: plugin authors responsible for maintenance, Flyte maintainers for approvals/merging
Triage permissions for non-binding approvals to be explored

#### Next Steps
- Eduardo to review the error aggregation RFC in detail
- David to tag Paul for a sanity check on the multi-error output reader proposal
- Fabio to potentially work on implementation if RFC is accepted
- Consider organizing a talk/panel on distributed training with Flyte
- Update community plugin RFC with non-binding approval process for plugin maintainers

Introducing new RFC for tuple support @ 4:49
Michael presented a new RFC to add support for named tuples and tuple types in Flyte. The key goals are to allow users to specify the name of a tuple and the names of its fields, and to add new types to support these new tuple constructs. The group discussed various implementation details and tradeoffs, such as how to handle the case where a tuple is returned as part of a larger output structure.

Exploring options for tuple support @ 9:00
The group explored different approaches for implementing tuple support, including:

Treating tuples as a first-class type with special handling
Treating tuples the same as lists, with no special support
Creating a new "univariate tuple" type distinct from regular tuples The group agreed that a prototype implementation would be helpful to better understand the tradeoffs and implications of the different approaches.
Discussing impact on existing Flight features @ 27:39
The group discussed how adding tuple support could impact existing Flight features, such as the ability to reference fields in named tuples returned by tasks. There were concerns about maintaining backwards compatibility, and the group agreed that the prototype should aim to preserve existing behaviors where possible.

Recap and next steps @ 39:59
The group summarized the key open questions and agreed that Michael should work on a prototype implementation to further explore the different approaches. The group will continue the discussion asynchronously and revisit the topic in a future meeting.

Changing meeting time to regular schedule @ 0:00

David proposed moving the meeting back to the regular time of every other Thursday at 11am Pacific, as the alternating schedule has had limited success and excludes many US-based contributors. The group agreed to this change.

New RFC: Serialized execution of launch plans @ 1:36

Eduardo introduced a new RFC to allow serialized execution of launch plans, which has been a long-requested feature. The goal is to provide a mechanism to control concurrency at the workflow level, such as for scheduled runs. The group discussed some potential edge cases and implications, and agreed to review the RFC in more detail.

New RFC: Offloading large literals to blob storage @ 11:09

Eduardo also presented a new RFC to address the issue of hitting GRPC limits with large fan-out jobs, by offloading large literals to blob storage. This is initially being scoped for map tasks, but the plan is to extend it to other workflow types. The group was generally supportive of this proposal.

Incubator project: Task execution optimization @ 14:03

David noted a recent entry in the incubator project list around task execution optimization, and encouraged the group to review and provide feedback on the discussion thread if they have strong opinions.

Meeting wrap-up @ 15:01

The group concluded the meeting, with a reminder to continue discussing the RFC proposals on the relevant channels.

- RFC discussion

Error handling for distributed tasks @ 2:03
Fabio presented a proposal to address the issue of race conditions when multiple worker pods try to write error files during a distributed training task. The goal is to make error handling more deterministic by allowing each worker pod to write its own error file, so the first error can be identified as the likely root cause. The team discussed potential implementation approaches and open questions around how the plugin should communicate the need for multiple error file outputs.

Handling of task outputs @ 5:16
The group explored how task outputs are currently handled, noting that some plugins have race conditions for outputs similar to the error file issue. The team discussed whether the plugin should be responsible for handling output communication to avoid issues like having to return a list of outputs instead of a single value.

Backwards compatibility for new error handling @ 13:05
Eduardo raised the question of the backwards compatibility story for the proposed error handling changes. The team discussed a plan to leverage metadata and type transformations to maintain compatibility with existing tasks, while allowing the new error handling functionality.

Community contributed plugins @ 16:47
David brought up the topic of how community contributed plugins are currently handled, noting that they automatically become maintenance tasks for the core team. The group agreed this is not ideal, and discussed the need for a process to better manage community contributions, potentially by marking them as "community" plugins.

- Open mic  

Java SDK usage and gaps @ 19:36
Andy from Citrine Informatics shared his experience and challenges in trying to adopt the Java SDK for Flyte, including issues with data types, deployment, and the overall state of the Java ecosystem compared to the Python SDK. The group discussed potential ways to better support the Java use case, including documentation, roadmapping, and enabling more community contributions.

      * Next step: create an RFC Incubator post. David to promote it in the community to find other community members who want to commment on it.
  * Task node overrides still partially broken (`task_config`), see [issue](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/4543#issuecomment-2127217720). Do we remove the `task_config` override ([beta](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/91cfb973eecca2ef35f0f5959f9754a1f51af451/flytekit/core/node.py#L187)) or is there a way to fix it? To fix it, we'd have to be able to access the task template in `with_overrides` as the backend is not aware of the task_config itself.
    * Notes:
      * Eduardo to explore how to expose the task_config, which would require re routing
      * Fabio: if we could override the template would be better than sending the task_config to the backend.
      * Eduardo: further discussion is needed, to fix it for all fields.

    * [Project isolation RFC updates](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/5204)
      * Notes:
        * Robert reviewed the current implementation of the project isolation feature, which uses an interceptor to check the user's access permissions based on claims in the token. The team discussed potential weaknesses in the current approach, such as the need to manually maintain a list of all endpoints, and explored alternative solutions like using the user ID instead of claims. 
Eduardo suggested extending the project isolation feature to support other dimensions like environment, in order to create a more comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system. The team agreed this could be a valuable enhancement, while being mindful of not conflicting with union.ai's commercial offering.

            From [docs](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/deployment/multicluster.html#data-plane-deployment):

            ```yaml
            configmap:
              admin:
                admin:
                  endpoint: <your-Ingress-FQDN>:443 #indicate the URL you're using to connect to Flyte
                  insecure: false #enables secure communication over SSL. Requires a signed certificate
              catalog:
                catalog-cache:
                  endpoint: <your-Ingress-FQDN>:443
                  insecure: false
            ```     
            
            How does auth work if one was to expose datacatalog through the ingress?
            
            * **Notes**: datacatalog currently doesn't use auth. The team agreed to add a disclaimer in the docs clarifying that users need to handle the networking and authentication for these cross-cluster connections.
            * [PR is merged](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/pull/5345)

        * Can cluster labels be specified for projects via the helm values? See [issue](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/4029#issuecomment-2100479357). (Fabio)
        * When using the cluster in which the control plane is deployed also as a dataplane, it would be nice to use in-cluster credentials. Would you agree if I add such an option? (Fabio)
            ```yaml
            configmap:
              clusters:
               clusterConfigs:
               - name: "dataplane_1"
                 endpoint: https://<your-dataplane1-kubeapi-endpoint>:443
                 enabled: true
                 auth:
                    type: "file_path"
                    tokenPath: "/var/run/credentials/dataplane_1_token"
                    certPath: "/var/run/credentials/dataplane_1_cacert"
               - name: "controlplane"
                 inCluster: true  # Proposed flag

    * Ownership of plugins. Should there be something like `flytekitplugins.contrib.x` to signal that a plugin is purely community maintained? Then some process to promote out of `.contrib`.
      * Notes
        * Fabio proposed introducing a "contrib" tag for community-maintained plugins, to help users better understand the support and maintenance levels for different plugins. The team agreed this was a good idea and will explore the details of how to implement this in a future RFC.
    * Support local pip-installable packages in ImageSpec and pyflyte run --remote: https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/5343

### Minutes
**Notification System Proposal**: Han-Ru Chen proposes adding a notification system to Flyte Interactive Plugin to notify users when the VSCode server is about to terminate. However, there's a discussion about whether this should be integrated into flyteadmin instead.  
**Cluster Pool Proposal**: Rafael Raposo presents a proposal for implementing a cluster pool feature, allowing the selection of execution time and destination clusters for workflows.
Discussion on Implementation: There's a discussion about whether existing labels for clusters can be reused for specifying execution time or if a new mechanism is needed.  
**Action Items:**  
Han-Run Chen agrees to close the notification system proposal.
Rafael and Fabio agree to explore the implementation details of the cluster pool proposal further.  
**Working Groups Update:**
The Config Overrides Working Group is discussed for possible retirement due to inactivity.  
**Incubator Ideas:**  
Existing ideas in the incubator are mentioned, with no significant updates or discussions.
Conclusion: The meeting concludes with a reminder to revisit the ideas in the incubator and an acknowledgment of potential future discussions.

* **Minutes**:

Welcome and introductions @ 0:00

David welcomed attendees including new community member Austin, who aims to learn MLOps through Flyte.

Discussion of new RFCs and proposals @ 3:26

Members discussed a proposal for a .flyteignore file to ignore files during registration. They agreed Bernhard should open an issue. Kevin explained challenges with notification plugins, agreeing to discuss further offline.

Proposed .flyteignore file for ignoring files @ 19:15

Bernhard proposed a .flyteignore file to avoid unintentionally including large files during fast registration. Members agreed this could prevent user frustration and improve the experience. Bernhard offered to submit an initial implementation.

Improving object serialization between tasks @ 26:53

Fabio demonstrated an issue where objects serialized during registration are saved locally instead of the blob store. Members agreed the system should default to the blob store to avoid workflow failures. They will further discuss improving usability.

Improving dynamic workflow debugging @ 31:23

Fabio highlighted frustrations debugging dynamic workflows due to unclear errors. Members agreed the UI should surface detailed error messages from preparer to aid users. John will investigate propagating errors appropriately in the UI.

Discussion of meeting logistics and community involvement @ 41:11

David asked about meeting frequency and timezones. Members agreed to biweekly meetings but explore alternating times to include others. They aim to foster a more welcoming community through clear communication.

* Minutes:  
The team discussed an experiment they conducted to implement a minimal change in propeller to address user confusion regarding retries. They found that the implementation resolved most cases and made a small PR to adapt the one case where it didn't, awaiting feedback from customers and Eduardo.

The team discussed the behavior of retries and attempts in the system. They debated whether to switch to a non-interruptible behavior for the last system failure and considered introducing a negative number configuration value for the last retry.

David discussed updates on working groups and proposals, but there were no significant comments or new ideas. Fabio introduced a new bot in the flag repo to label and close stale issues, and also discussed the GCP identity hour proxy initiative, which aims to enhance security by allowing only authenticated requests to reach the back end.

Fabio and Haytham discussed the authentication setup for integrating a proxy with the flyteadmin. They explored different options, including using ID tokens and proxy authorization headers, and discussed the possibility of extending the authentication mechanism to other proxies in the future.

Haytham asked about the dependency on Google libraries in a command. Fabio explained that the command uses a standard OAuth2 flow with a dependency on a Google library, but it is only added to the specific plugin and not to the main flyteKit. They agreed to discuss further offline or in the next meeting

* Notes

  
  - In the discussion, Eduardo suggested internally updating the retry behavior RFC or proposing an alternative, while Fabio mentioned resolving questions and trying a prototype PR in the staging cluster. They also discussed renaming the extra plugin service to "Flyte agents" and the progress of other RFCs. 
  - The team discussed various proposals and ideas, including an alternative software use case, the implementation of overrides in workflows, and a proposal to resolve execution time parameters in the database. They also talked about the possibility of merging the Flyte-related repositories into a mono repo to improve the development experience.
  - In the discussion, Eduardo informed everyone that they were moving to a monorepo, which would streamline the development experience and make it easier for contributors to make single PRs. Bernhard expressed his support for the move, mentioning that it would lower the entry barrier for contributors and make it easier to test changes. 
  - Fabio discussed the implementation of encryption between the load balancer and the backend using Flight Admin, and mentioned the possibility of rotating the server certificates using a Terraform resource. He also mentioned the integration of identity-web anonymously and the decision to implement it on the client side for easier deployment.
  - Fabio discussed his idea of extending the authentication process by running a second command to generate a token for a proxy in front of the application. He opened a pull request for a plugin called Flight IAP and mentioned the need for someone from the team to review and test it.
